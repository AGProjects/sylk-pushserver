Description: 
        Sylk Pushserver was designed to act as a central dispatcher for mobile push
        notifications inside RTC provider infrastructures.  Both the provider and
        the mobile application customer, in the case of a shared infrastructure, can
        easily audit problems related to the processing of push notifications.
